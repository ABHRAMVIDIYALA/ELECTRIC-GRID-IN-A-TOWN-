# ELECTRIC-GRID-IN-A-TOWN-Lets take a situation where we have a city which has so many towns in it, and the distances between pairs of the town are known. The goal is to create a system of electric power lines that would minimize the total distance (and thus the construction cost), yet reach every town. 
The problem which we chose comes under the domain of GREEDY METHOD. Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit
